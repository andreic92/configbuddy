file action for github - maybe another action?
package action - alternatives for same package or another package alternative; e.g.:parcellite alternative to klipper
package action - from package manager or from package file (deb, rpm, etc)
package action - possiblity to download the specified file from an URL (google drive, dropbox, ftp, etc)


FIXED
##
there seems to be an issue when the wanted final_destination is a directory or a bad link (red one)
# problem was in system_utils#exists_file - exists function returns false if the symlink is broken. lexists is the right choice
##
add in config a globals section(for the moment what to do on exception...ignore command, interrup exec)
# Done
